# Getting Started with Create React App

The frontend React App for the tennis API has been hosted using firebase. You access the url here: [https://tennis-api-frontend.web.app](https://tennis-api-frontend.web.app).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Functions

As of now, a user can do three things: 

1. Get H2H matchup history
2. Get individual player career statistics
3. Get player activity by year

I plan to add more functionalities.

### Rivalries

To see a H2H matchup, click on the tab "H2H Matches", enter the names of two players, and click "Get Rivalry Matches". As of now, there is only support for ATP players. I plan to incorporate the same functionalities for the WTA soon.

### Individual Player Statistics

To see an individual player's career statistics, click the tab "Individual Player Stats", enter the name of a player, and click "Get Player Stats".

### Individual Player Activity

To see an individual player's activity, click the tab "Individual Player Activity", enter the name of a player, and click "Get Player Activity". Then below, enter a year and click "Filter by Year".

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
